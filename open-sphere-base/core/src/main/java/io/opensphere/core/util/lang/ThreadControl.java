/**
 * Control class for managing paused and cancelled threads. A thread can be
 * paused or cancelled using {@link #pauseThread(Thread)} or
 * {@link #cancelThread(Thread)}, which will cause the subject thread to be
 * interrupted. The interrupted thread should then call
 * {@link #pollThreadCancelled()} to determine if it has been cancelled, and
 * abort processing if so. If the thread has not been cancelled, the thread
 * should call {@link #waitForUnpause()} to suspend processing. If the thread
 * was paused, when it is time to unpause the thread,
 * {@link #unpauseThread(Thread)} should be called, which will notify the
 * subject thread to continue processing, and the call to
 * {@link #waitForUnpause()} will return. Long-running operations should call
 * {@link #check()} periodically, which will check for an interrupt and either
 * wait for the unpause or throw an {@link InterruptedException} if the thread
 * is cancelled.
